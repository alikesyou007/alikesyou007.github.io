## Hello there. 

![me](/images/me.jpg)

I go by A. Lei (like Lie). I consider myself to be a bit of a unicorn when it comes to Infosec. I'm the exact opposite of what most people would picture a "hacker" to be and I love it. I consider myself to be more of a **purple team** type of gal. I've spent the majority of my career doing blue team type of work but am now venturing off on the red team. I'm a firm believer that the best defender has the technical acumen of a red offender. 

I'm versed in both Linux and Windows. I have several certifications (which really are just the good ol' "check the block" type of thing) including **CISSP, CISM, GSEC, GCIA, GPEN, GCFA**, to name some. I've worked in both the private and public sector from government/military to healthcare to entertainment so I've seen a myriad of different situations.



### More Information

I'm just here trying to get better everyday at my craft. I enjoy particiapting in CTFs. I have to admit that in the past I was really bad at doing write-ups. I'm trying to change the paradigm on that now.
